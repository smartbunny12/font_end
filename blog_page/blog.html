	<h2>Accuracy, Precision, Recall or F1?</h2>

	<p class="quote">Often when I talk to organizations that are looking to implement data science into their processes, they often ask the question, How do I get the most accurate model?. And I asked further, What business challenge are you trying to solve using the model? and I will get the puzzling look because the question that I posed does not really answer their question. 
	</p>

	<p>I will then need to explain why I asked the question before we start exploring if Accuracy is the be-all and end-all model metric that we shall choose our “best” model from.</p>

	<p>So I thought I will explain in this blog post that Accuracy need not necessary be the one-and-only model metrics data scientists chase and include simple explanation of other metrics as well.

	<h2>If We Care For Robots, Who Will Care For Us? (Darcy Reeder)</h2>
	<p class="quote">Our willingness to engage with the inanimate does not depend on being deceived but on wanting to fill in the blanks. By Dr. Sherry Turkle</p>

	<p>All I knew was the University of Washington was going to pay me pretty well for an hour and a half of my time. They said something about a guided tour of the HINTS Lab (Human Interaction With Nature and Technological Systems), which they would videotape, and then a sit-down interview afterward.</p>

	<p>Robovie gave me a tour of the Japanese-inspired computer lab. We small-talked while I raked the sand in the indoor Zen rock garden. Robovie showed me a bonsai tree, asked me to point at Japan on a map on the wall. Then we collaborated on a creativity puzzle on a big screen.</p>
